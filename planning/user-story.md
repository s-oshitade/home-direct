# USER STORY

* As a `user`, I can `property listings` by price, because I want to explore options within my budget
* As a `user`, I can specify `favorite property listings`, because I want to review them later
* As a `user (buyer)`, I can send `messages` to the `user(seller)` that owns the listing, because I want to make clarifications/negotiation [SMS]
* As `admin`, I can post items which can be seen by others, because my job is to curate residential `properties` 
* As `admin`, I can remove properties from the site, because I need to keep the property listings updated
