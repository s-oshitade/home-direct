# USER STORY

1. As a `user`, I can see `featured property listings` on the `main feed`, because I want to see the available options of listed properties
2. As a `user`, I can view `property listings` by price, because I want to explore options within my budget
3. As a `user`, I can specify `favorite property listings`, because I want to review them later
4. As a `user (buyer)`, I can send `messages` to the `user(seller)` that owns the listing, because I want to make clarifications/negotiation [SMS]
5. As `admin`, I can post items which can be seen by others, because my job is to curate residential `properties` 
6. As `admin`, I can remove properties from the site, because I need to keep the property listings updated
7. As `admin`, I can mark items as SOLD, because I should not allow buyers to consider properties that are no longer available for purchase
8. As `admin`, I can send a `message` via app, email, or text back on negotiations in buying properties
